ðŸš€ Problems Solved
1. Rotate Linked List
Problem: Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

Output: [4,5,1,2,3]

Approach: Count nodes, link last to first, break at appropriate position.

2. Plus One
Problem: Given an array of digits representing a large integer, increment the integer by one.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3]

Output: [1,2,4]

Approach: Traverse from the end, manage carry, insert 1 at the beginning if needed.
